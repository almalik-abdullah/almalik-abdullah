## Good Day, my name is Almalik Abdullah


### History about my coding

#### how i started 
i first started coding during my (pre-university). There was a course called introduction to programming. The course was boring as we only did beginner work and projects that are not really interesting and wasn't challenging. Hence i made a poor conclusion that i'm not meant to code or be programmer. few years went by, i need to take a subject called data analytics. This subject too was poorly taught as the lecturers are from applied science department and not IT department. So i feel like i had is zero knowledge about this course despite getting B (other students got worse result). hence i spent my semester break studying this course all over again by myself. Then i find out that this is something i really good at and enjoy doing. i fell in love with data analytics. During my final year, i decided to take a minor degree in Big Data Analytics. Then, after university i started doing side projects after side projects to learn more about data science as whatever i learnt in my degree alone is not enough.

#### my first job
after graduation i got a job with a wholesale business. this business express desire to use my skills for business intelligence, analytics and optimization.
